How to Use
----------
There are two ways to run the game, the first being easier the second.

### Running the Pre-Compiled Game (Easier)
1. Download the latest executable release and run it.

### Running Directly from Source Code (Harder)
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Run main.py using Python 3.6+ (see requirements.txt).


Key Game Features
-----------------
- Single player mode, containing four levels.
- Local coop mode, containing three levels.
- A boss in both modes.
- Several menus and UI for both modes.
- Cutscenes for single player mode.


Key Code Features
-----------------
- Several engines (e.g. core, scene, menu, and collision).
- Swappable components that attach to any class (e.g render, audio, physics).
- Components that can easily be tweaked (e.g. animations, dialogues, camera).
- Loader module responsible for IO of images and audio.
- Event-driven communication between classes.
